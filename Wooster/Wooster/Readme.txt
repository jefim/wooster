Wooster is cool! Now, some attribution:

== The cog icon that opens settings ==
The cog (gear) icon used in the main Wooster view is created by the great guys at http://icomoon.io. Be sure to check those guys out - they have really cool icons there.
The icon license is CC BY 3.0 / http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ (not sure if this should be mentioned or not, so I'm putting it here just to be sure).

== Hotkey code ==
I was too lazy to write interop code so I copied some code (and modified it a bit) from this blog: http://bloggablea.wordpress.com/2007/05/01/global-hotkeys-with-net/. Thank them!
